This is the code accompanying the paper "Designing Transportable Experiments Under S-Admissablility". We consider the problem of designing experiments performed on a source population in order to estimate the effect on a target population. The result was published in the International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics (AISTATS 2021).
